         //    a) Scope is the range of the program that a variable can be used in.  Being public
         //       allows access by everyone.
         //    b) Static methods are classes provided to perform common tasks that do not 
         //       require specific objects.
         //    c) The return type is a double that is the outcome of multiplying height * width.
         //    d) The method's name is getArea
         //    e) This method expects two variables, a double height and a double width.
         //    f) The method's body is defined by it's brackets {}.
         
         // 3) Method's that are provided with a framework are methods that have been extensively
         //    debuged and optimized.  They are called using the form ClassName.MethodName(arguments)
         //    A user defined method is on that you add yourself to your program.  For reliability
         //    and ease of use it's most likely better to use methods from a framework.

         // 4) A static method allows you to have direct access to the data from the method 
         //    without having to create an object to recieve your data.
